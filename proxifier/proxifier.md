# [Proxifier-Keygen](https://github.com/Danz17/Proxifier-Keygen)

A little keygen I wrote recently after I reversed [Proxifier](https://www.proxifier.com/)'s simplistic key checking algorithm. The keys I've found on Google are dating from 2014 and still work on the current Proxifier version, so this keygen's purpose is merely educational.

2023 still work.
